\section{the experiment}
This works focuses on comparing the different miss use models to a reference
calculation in which a single large cascade is build and designed to directly
produce \gls{HEU} from natural uranium.
This works uses the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator to allow material exchange
between facilities.

\subsection{The cascade configuration}
\subsubsection{reference}
As mentioned previously, all the further calculations will be compared to the
most favorable configuration to produce \gls{HEU}, where all the available
centrifuges are used in a single large cascade designed to directly produce \gls{HEU}
from natural uranium, with a tail assay close to $0.3w\%$ uranium. The design
characteristic of the reference cascade are summarized in Table
\ref{tab:cascade_config}.

\subsubsection{default cascade}
The default cascade is the cascade design for normal civilian enrichment
operation, enriching natural uranium to about $3.5w\%$. This cascade will be
layered and fed with uranium at higher enrichment to evaluate the possibility
to used them, with few or no tuning, to produce \gls{HEU}. The characteristics of
the default cascade are summarized in Table \ref{tab:cascade_config}.

\subsection{scenarios}
Seven different scenarios have been simulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item one as the reference calculation, with a single centrifuges designed to
    produce directly \gls{HEU} from natural uranium,
\item three calculations (one per miss-use model) were default cascade are
    chained to produce \gls{HEU}, without recycling the tails of each cascade,
    the cascade tails are directly sent to the waste,
\item three calculations (one per miss-use model) were default cascade are
    chained to produce \gls{HEU}, the tails of each cascade are recycled, blending
    the tail of one level in the feed of the previous level of
    cascades (see Figure \ref{fig:cascade_level}.
\end{itemize}
In the following, cascades can be connected in tandem, where each set of cascade
in parallel is called a ``level``, as illustrated on Figure
\ref{fig:cascade_level}.

    red. The dashed orange line represent the alternative tail flow with
    recycling them.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Level population}
In order to assign the optimum number of cascade to each level a virtual cut as
been computed as:
\begin{equation}
    \theta^{v}_{i} = \frac{F_{i}-T_{i}}{P_{i}-T_{i}},
\end{equation}
where, i represents a level of cascade and $F_{i}$, $P_{i}$ and $T_{i}$
respectively the feed, product and tail assay of the cascades at this level.

A flow equation similar to \eqref{eq:flow} is then solve to get the optimum
number of cascade per level. When the tail are not recycled, the $(1-\theta)$
terms are removed from the flow equation.  The results of the level population
are summarized in Table \ref{tab:level}.
