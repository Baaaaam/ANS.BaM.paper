\section{Introduction}

Fuel cycle simulations, as any simulation process, do not produce results
without errors. Those errors have different sources: data uncertainties (when
the simulation relies on previously estimated/measured metrics), modeling
uncertainties (produced by the simplification made by the simulator) and the
``functional`` uncertainty (uncertainty on the operation parameters of the
different facilities).

Some treaty verification scenarios require estimating historical fissile
material production based on records of facility operation and material
transfer.  If the measurements of facility operation and material transfer are
subject to uncertainty, the total production quantities will then also be
uncertain, creating an opportunity for undetected diversion.  This study seeks
to understand which measures of facility operation have the most impact on the
uncertainty of fissile material production across a complete fuel cycle.  A
``Total Monte Carlo'' approach will be applied to the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator
\cite{cyclus} to estimate output metrics uncertainty caused by individual
facility uncertainties.

\section{Method}

To estimate the uncertainty on fuel cycle output metrics, a ``Total Monte
Carlo'' approach has been applied. In the following, output metric uncertainty
corresponds to the Standard Deviation of the output metrics over about 200
different simulations. For each uncertainty associated parameter, an
artificially large uncertainty of $10\%$ have been Normally distributed.

To pursuit this work, both the Cycamore\cite{cycamore} package and the
CyCLASS\cite{cyclass} have been updated to deal with uncertainty in different
operational parameters of their different facility.  Table
\ref{tab:package_uncertainty} summarize all the modification implemented in the
different facilities present in Cycamore and CyCLASS.

\section{The Experiment}
\subsection{The Fuel Cycle}
This work aims to assess the impact of the functional uncertainties of a
simple transition (see Figure \ref{fig:cycle}) inspired from the EG23 of the Screening And
Evaluation Group\cite{FCO}: a transition from light water reactors fleet loaded
with \glspl{UOX} fuel to a sodium fast reactors fleet loaded \glspl{MOX} fuel, considering an
$1\%/$y grows of the generated power (Figure \ref{fig:power}).
\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.31]{cycle.png}
  \caption{Illustration of the material flow between the different facilities,
  with in green each operational parameters associated with an
  uncertainty.}\label{fig:cycle}
\end{figure}

As illustrated on Figure \ref{fig:power}, the transition starts with a fleet
fully composed by \glspl{LWR} loaded with enriched \glspl{UOX} fuel. The actual
transition starts around year 35, with the deployment of \glspl{FBR}, loaded
with Mixed oxide fuel (MOX), consisting of plutonium blended with natural
uranium. Once the transition to a full \glspl{FBR} fleet is completed, the
\glspl{FBR} fleet is slowly replaced with \glspl{FBR} with a lower breeding
ratio. 

\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.32]{power.png}
    \caption{Electric power generated over time, with in blue the full production,
        in orange the \glspl{LWR} contribution, in green the hight breeding ratio
        \glspl{FBR} and in red the low breeding ratio \glspl{FBR}.}\label{fig:power}
\end{figure}


The plutonium, required for the \glspl{MOX} fabrication, is reprocessed
from all used fuel, at first only used UOX, then used MOX fuel as they start to
be available for reprocessing.

Both fuel reprocessing and fabrication are done at a constant rate (constrained
by the feed materials availabilities). The enrichment of the UOX is processed on
demand. Buffer storages (not shown on Figure \ref{fig:cycle}) is present between
all facilities with constant processing rates.


\subsection{Uncertainty Measurements}
In this specific study, one will only focus on the uncertainty on the produced
electric power as a function of time, on the total quantity of natural uranium
used and on the total unused fissile inventory (unused reprocessed plutonium).
In order to estimate the total uncertainty on those 3 parameters as well as the
individual contribution of the operational parameters several set of (199)
simulations have been completed.  All uncertainty are computed as the standard
deviation over over all the calculations in the set.

In addition to the set with all parameters are sampled according to their
uncertainty, a set a have been computed for each parameter, with all the other
remaining fixed to the reference value.


\subsection{Generated Power}
By construction, the very low uncertainty (Figure \ref{fig:power_full}) on the
generated power is expected. 

\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{power_full}
    \caption{Electric power generated as a function of time. The black line
        represents the reference calculation and the blue zone
        represents the 1 $\sigma$ uncertainty distribution.}\label{fig:power_full}
\end{figure}

Indeed the transition scenario has been design to allow
all the reactors to receive the fuel as needed allowing them to be producing
power all the time. This ensure that the uncertainty measured on other
parameters are not influence by the reactors miss-loadings.

\subsection{Natural Uranium Consumption}

Figure \ref{fig:unat_full} represents the cumulative natural uranium
consumption as a function of time. The uncertainty on the cumulative uranium
consumption grows as expected with the time and the loading of the \glspl{LWR}.
The increase stops around year 125y with the decommissioning of the last
\glspl{LWR}.

\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{unat_full}
    \caption{Cumulative consumption of natural uranium as a function of time. The black line
        represents the reference calculation and the blue zone
        represents the 1 $\sigma$ uncertainty distribution.}\label{fig:unat_full}
\end{figure}


The fluctuation of the full relative uncertainty at low time are because of the
sensitivity to the fuel loading: all reactors at the beginning have synchronised
cycle, this phenomenon disappear with the gradual decommissioning of the initial
reactor, spread on 50 years. 


\begin{figure}[h!!] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{unat_uncer}
    \caption{Cumulative natural uranium consumption relative uncertainty, with
    in black the total uncertainty at 1$\sigma$, and in color the uncertainty
    contribution of each parameter: cooling time (blue), fuel enrichment (red),
    cycle time (green), thermal power(brown), separation efficiency (light
    blue).}\label{fig:unatr_uncer}
\end{figure}
The relative uncertainty of the total uranium consumption starts at about
$5.5\%$ a slowly drops and stabilise around $3\%$.

As expected, cooling time, separation efficiency and thermal power does
not affect the natural uranium consumption.
The uncertainty on the natural uranium consumption is dominated by the
\glspl{LWR} cycle length: shorter the cycle length is, the more fuel will be
loaded.  

As the number of deployed \glspl{LWR} reactors increases, as each parameters is
sampled once for each facilities, the average length of the cycle (as well as
the number of loaded batches) converges to the reference value.
The fuel enrichment and the tail assay contribution follow a smoother behavior,
so as the total relative uncertainty decrease, their contribution increases over
time.
