\section{Introduction}

Fuel cycle simulations, as any simulation process, do not produce results
without errors. Those errors have different sources: data uncertainties (when
the simulation relies on previously estimated/measured metrics), modeling
uncertainties (produced by the simplification made by the simulator) and the
``functional`` uncertainty (uncertainty on the operation parameters of the
different facilities).

Some treaty verification scenarios require estimating historical fissile
material production based on records of facility operation and material
transfer.  If the measurements of facility operation and material transfer are
subject to uncertainty, the total production quantities will then also be
uncertain, creating an opportunity for undetected diversion.  This study seeks
to understand which measures of facility operation have the most impact on the
uncertainty of fissile material production across a complete fuel cycle.  A
``Total Monte Carlo'' approach will be applied to the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator
\cite{cyclus} to estimate output metrics uncertainty caused by individual
facility uncertainties.

\section{Method}

To estimate the uncertainty on fuel cycle output metrics, a ``Total Monte
Carlo'' approach has been applied. In the following, output metric uncertainty
corresponds to the Standard Deviation of the output metrics over about 200
different simulations. For each deployed facilities, the uncertainty associated
parameters have been a normally distributed with an artificially large standard
deviation of $10\%$.

To pursuit this work, both the Cycamore\cite{cycamore} package and the
CyCLASS\cite{cyclass} have been updated to deal with uncertainty in different
operational parameters of their different facility.  Table
\ref{tab:package_uncertainty} summarize all the modification implemented in the
different facilities present in Cycamore and CyCLASS.

\end{table}

Note: the fuel enrichment is determined by a fuel fabrication model\cite{leniau} which
express a fissile fraction required in the fuel to reach a target
burnup at the end of irradiation. In this study, the uncertainty on the fuel
enrichment is not applied directly on the effective enrichment but on the target
parameter (the burnup), which leads to to a fuel enrichment uncertainty close to
$10\%$. 



\section{The Experiment}
\subsection{The Fuel Cycle}
This work aims to assess the impact of the functional uncertainties of a
simple transition (see Figure \ref{fig:cycle}) inspired from the EG23 of the Screening And
Evaluation Group\cite{FCO}: a transition from light water reactors fleet loaded
with \glspl{UOX} fuel to a sodium fast reactors fleet loaded \glspl{MOX} fuel, considering an
$1\%/$y grows of the generated power (Figure \ref{fig:power}).
\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom

  \includegraphics[scale=0.31]{cycle.png}
  \caption{Illustration of the material flow between the different facilities,
  with in green each operational parameters associated with an
  uncertainty.}\label{fig:cycle}
\end{figure}

As illustrated on Figure \ref{fig:power}, the transition starts with a fleet
fully composed by \glspl{LWR} loaded with enriched \glspl{UOX} fuel. The actual
transition starts around year 35, with the deployment of \glspl{FBR}, loaded
with Mixed oxide fuel (MOX), consisting of plutonium blended with natural
uranium. Once the transition to a full \glspl{FBR} fleet is completed, the
\glspl{FBR} fleet is slowly replaced with \glspl{FBR} with a lower breeding
ratio. 

\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.32]{power.png}
    \caption{Electric power generated over time, with in blue the full production,
        in orange the \glspl{LWR} contribution, in green the hight breeding ratio
        \glspl{FBR} and in red the low breeding ratio \glspl{FBR}.}\label{fig:power}
\end{figure}


The plutonium, required for the \glspl{MOX} fabrication, is reprocessed from all
used fuel, at first only used UOX, then used MOX fuel as they start to be
available for reprocessing.

Both fuel reprocessing and fabrication are done at a constant rate (constrained
by the feed materials availabilities). The enrichment of the UOX is processed on
demand. Buffer storages (not shown on Figure \ref{fig:cycle}) is present between
all facilities with constant processing rates.


\subsection{Uncertainty Measurements}
In this specific study, one will only focus on the uncertainty on the produced
electric power as a function of time, on the total quantity of natural uranium
used and on the total unused fissile inventory (unused reprocessed plutonium).
In order to estimate the total uncertainty on those 3 parameters as well as the
individual contribution of the operational parameters several set of (199)
simulations have been completed.  All uncertainty are computed as the standard
deviation over over all the calculations in the set.

In addition to the set with all parameters are sampled according to their
uncertainty, a set a have been computed for each parameter, with all the other
remaining fixed to the reference value.


\subsection{Generated Power}
By construction, the very low uncertainty (Figure \ref{fig:power_full}) on the
generated power is expected. 

\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{power_full}
    \caption{Electric power generated as a function of time. The black line
        represents the reference calculation and the blue zone
        represents the 1 $\sigma$ uncertainty distribution.}\label{fig:power_full}
\end{figure}

Indeed the transition scenario has been design to allow all the reactors to
receive the fuel as needed allowing them to be producing power all the time.
This ensure that the uncertainty measured on other parameters are not influence
by the reactors miss-loadings.

\subsection{Natural Uranium Consumption}

Figure \ref{fig:unat_full} represents the cumulative natural uranium
consumption as a function of time. The uncertainty on the cumulative uranium
consumption grows as expected with the time and the loading of the \glspl{LWR}.
The increase stops around year 125y with the decommissioning of the last
\glspl{LWR}.

\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{unat_full}
    \caption{Cumulative consumption of natural uranium as a function of time. The black line
        represents the reference calculation and the blue zone
        represents the 1 $\sigma$ uncertainty distribution.}\label{fig:unat_full}
\end{figure}


The fluctuation of the full relative uncertainty at low time are because of the
sensitivity to the fuel loading: all reactors at the beginning have synchronised
cycle, this phenomenon disappears with the gradual decommissioning of the initial
reactor, spread on 50 years. 


\begin{figure}[h!!] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{unat_uncer}
    \caption{Cumulative natural uranium consumption relative uncertainty, with
    in black the total uncertainty at 1$\sigma$, and in color the uncertainty
    contribution of each parameter: cooling time (blue), fuel enrichment (red),
    cycle time (green), thermal power(brown), separation efficiency (light
    blue).}\label{fig:unatr_uncer}
\end{figure}
The relative uncertainty of the total uranium consumption starts at about
$5.5\%$ a slowly drops and stabilise around $3\%$.

As expected, cooling time, separation efficiency and thermal power does not
affect the natural uranium consumption.  The uncertainty on the natural uranium
consumption is dominated by the \glspl{LWR} cycle length: shorter the cycle
length is, the more fuel will be loaded.  

As the number of deployed \glspl{LWR} reactors increases, as each parameters is
sampled once for each facilities, the average length of the cycle (as well as
the number of loaded batches) converges to the reference value.
The fuel enrichment and the tail assay contribution follow a smoother behavior,
so as the total relative uncertainty decrease, their contribution increases over
time.

\subsection{Fissile Inventory}
As observed on Figure \ref{fig:pu_full}, the fissile inventory starts to grow on
year 40, with the deployment of the first reprocessing facility. It grows
during the first period of the \glspl{LWR} to \glspl{FBR}-A transition until
year 90, then decrease slightly as the last \glspl{LWR} are decommissioned.
When he steady state is reached (full \glspl{FBR} fleet), the plutonium
inventory starts to increase, as the breading ratio of the \glspl{FBR} is higher
than the deployment needs.

\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{pu_full}
    \caption{Fissile (plutonium) inventory as a function of time. The black line
        represents the reference calculation and the blue zone
        represents the 1 $\sigma$ uncertainty distribution.}\label{fig:pu_full}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!!] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{pu_uncer}
    \caption{Fissile (plutonium) inventory relative uncertainty, with
    in black the total uncertainty at 1$\sigma$, and in color the uncertainty
    contribution of each parameter: cooling time (blue), fuel enrichment (red),
    cycle time (green), thermal power(brown), separation efficiency (light
    blue).}\label{fig:pu_uncer}
\end{figure}

Regarding the uncertainty, beside the low inventory artefact observable around
year 40, the relative uncertainty starts at about $5\%$, and grows until year
125 to decrease up to $10\%$ at the end of the simulation time (180y), it seems
it will reach an equilibrium between $5$ and $10\%$...
Between year 40 and 70, the main contributor to the fissile inventory
uncertainty is the cycle length, as for the uranium needs, lower cycle length
implies more fuel loads. Never the less, around year 65 (see Figure
\ref{fig:used_fuel}), the stock of used fuel available for reprocessing starts
to lack, and the availability of the used fuel starts to dictate the evolution
of fissile in storage. The uncertainty weight is then slowly transferred from
the cycle length to the fuel cooling time.

\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.17]{used_fuel}
    \caption{Used fuel inventory.}\label{fig:used_fuel}
\end{figure}
Between year 90 and 120, the \glspl{FBR} deployment speed increases, it has to
compensate the non replacement of the decommissioned \glspl{LWR} as well as
follow the power demand. During this period the needs in plutonium are higher
than its productions, explaining the observed decrease of the total amount, and
the increase associated relative uncertainty.

As the transition ends, the plutonium breed from the \glspl{FBR} starts to be
sufficient to sustain the new \glspl{FBR} deployment to follow the power demand. 

It is also interesting to note that, the uncertainty contribution from the cycle
length are conversion toward the power contribution, such as the increase of
fuel loads effect tends to vanish and let its place to a discharge burnup
effect (the power uncertainty only affects the burnup of the fuel at discharge).

\section{Discussion}

Even if for the two output metric analysed there is no surprise such as the
identified uncertainty contributions, it is very interesting to be able to
measure them and rank them.

In this study, we can estimate than the cycle length uncertainty of $10\%$
varies from $3\%$ to $5\%$ on the total uranium needs uncertainty, where $\approx10\%$
on the enrichment implies a almost flat uncertainty of $2\%$, and the enrichment
tails uncertainty have an even lower contributions of $1\%$.

It is also very interesting to observe that while the plutonium inventory uncertainty
reach a pick at $30\%$, lead by the cooling time uncertainty contribution, the reactor
parameters seems to have a lower contribution, the cycle time contribution
picking at $10\%$ and stabilizing with the power contribution around $1\%$


\section{Conclusion}

Two main points can be deduced from this work. Firstly, in a transitional
fuel cycle, the uncertainty contributions to an output metric can vary over time
depending of various factors: deployment schedule artifact or pressure point in
the material flows.

Secondly, it is important to note the special character of the time related
parameters uncertainty in a fuel cycle study, such as cooling time and cycle
length. As the cycle length impact the discharge fuel burnup, it also affects
the frequency of the fuel loads, this, as well as the cooling may imply a
uncertainty on the material availability, which could lead to a large
uncertainty. Those kind of uncertainties will need a special treatment on further
uncertainty analysis.

This study aims to be a proof-of-principle for uncertainty propagation in
potential commercial fuel cycle transition and will to be extended to random
uncertainty. 

While the parameters contributing to natural uranium needs and fissile inventory
uncertainties might be obvious, such study allows to estimate each parameters
contribution, it could be less obvious for other parameters, such as
plutonium quality, waste compositions. Such studies could also provide research
guidance for nuclear archeology works, which aims to precisely estimate past
fissile production by the different nuclear countries.
