\section{Cascade Enrich Construction}
\subsection{Centrifuge properties}
In the present work, the analytical solution by R\"aetz \cite{ref} of the
differential equation for the gas centrifuge as described in \cite{Glaser2008}
is used. The different parameter of the centrifuges, such as average temperature
of the gas, rotation speed, height, feed flow rate, diameter, pressure ratio,
countercurent ratio, efficiency have been choosen to match the cascade design
describe in \cite{glaser2008} and \cite{Walker2017} using P-1 centrifuges and
repect the JCPOA aggrement.


\subsection{Cascade Design}

The cascade build as an ideal cascade, taht is to day, $\alpha =\beta = const$
for all stage of the cascade, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively represent
the feed to product and the feed to tail enrichment factors. 
$\alpha$ can be expressed as a function of the feed rate $F$, $\delta U(\theta)$ and $\theta$,
and $\beta$ as a function of $alpha$ and $\theta$: 
\begin{subequations} \label{eqs:alphabeta}
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:alpha}
    \alpha = \sqrt{\frac{2\delta U}{F} \frac{1-\theta}{\theta}}+1
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beta}
    \beta = R 
              \dfrac{1 - \dfrac{N - \theta \dfrac{\alpha R}{1+\alpha R}}{1 - \theta}}
                   {\dfrac{N - \theta \dfrac{\alpha R}{1+\alpha R}}{1 - \theta}} 
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

From equation \eqref{eq:alpha} and \eqref{eq:beta} it is possible to determine the cut value
(all other centrifuge parameters been fixed) allowing the have $\alpha=\beta$
required to build an ideal cascade.

As an ideal cascade is build, we only need to determine the proper cut value of
each stages, $\theta_{i}$, the value of $\alpha_{i}$ and $\beta_{i}$ remain
constant over the different stages.
It can be shown that $\theta_{i}$ can be computed from $\alpha$,
$\beta$ values and the feed assay, $N_{i}$:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \theta_{i} &=& \dfrac{N_{i} - N''_{i}}{N'_{i}-N''_{i}}\nonumber\\
           &=& \dfrac{N_{i} - \dfrac{1}{1 + \beta/R_{i}}}{ \dfrac{\alpha R_{i}}{1 + \alpha R_{i}} -
           \dfrac{1}{1 + \beta/R_{i}}} 
\end{eqnarray}

This algorithm assumes that the corresponding $\delta U$ (not re-computed) can be
achieve with the centrifuges.  With $\theta_{i}$ determined it is possible to
compute the product and the tail assay from $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
The design of the cascade is performed through 2 steps. First one determines the
number of stages and their configuration, adding stages following the previously
described procedure, until $N'_{last} > N'_{requested}$ and $N''_{last} <
N''_{requested}$. (Note that $N'_{last}$ corresponds to the product assay of the
last enrichment stage, and $N''_{last}$ to the tail assay of the last stripping
stage). This allows to determine the number of enriching and stripping stages as
well as their enrichment properties ($N_{i}$, $N'_{i}$,
$N''_{i}$,$\theta_{i}$i).

The second steps is dedicated on populating the cascade with centrifuges. One
first solves the linear flow equation to determine the theoretical flow in the
cascade:

\theta_{S} & -1             & 1-\theta_{S+2} & 0 & ... & 0 & 0            & 0   & 0              & 0 & ... & 0            & 0            & 0 \\
           &                &                &   &     &   &              & ... &                &   &     &              &              &   \\
0          & 0              & 0              & 0 & ... & 0 & \theta_{-1}  & -1  & 1 - \theta_{1} & 0 & ... & 0            & 0            & 0 \\
           &                &                &   &     &   &              & ... &                &   &     &              &              &   \\
0          & 0              & 0              & 0 & ... & 0 & 0            & 0   & 0              & 0 & ... & \theta_{E-2} & -1           & 1-\theta_{E} \\
0          & 0              & 0              & 0 & ... & 0 & 0            & 0   & 0              & 0 & ... & 0            & \theta_{E-1} & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\times 
\begin{bmatrix}
     F_{S}   \\
     F_{S+1} \\
     \cdots  \\
     F_{0}   \\
    \cdots   \\
    F_{E-1}  \\
    F_{E}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
     0   \\
     0 \\
     \cdots  \\
     F   \\
    \cdots   \\
    0  \\
    0
\end{bmatrix}
\label{eq:flow}
\end{equation}
\end{strip}
Once the relative flow on the different stages $F_{i}$ have been determined, the
cascade can be populated with actual machines, feeling up the different stages
until either the maximum number available of machines, either the maximum feed
flow is reached.


\subsection{Response to an non-ideal feed - $\theta_{i} = const$ hypothesis}

As it is practically impossible to get reliable information about tuning a
cascade when feed with a different feed assay than the one used for its design.

This tuning method assumes the cut of each stages are constant. As $\delta
U$ and $\alpha$ do not depend on the stage feed assay $N'$,the feed to product
ratio $\alpha$ do not change across the different stages. According to equation
\eqref{eq:beta} , when $\alpha$ and $\theta$ remaining, if the feed assay,
$N$, change $\beta$ has to change accordingly.  This will lead to brake of the
ideal status of the cascade, i.e.  $N_{i} \neq N'_{i-1} \neq N''_{i+1}$.

In order to compute the stage proper product and tails assay at each stages, one
need to blend the tails and the product from respectively the next and the
previous stage in order to determine the correct stage feed assay. As this is a
obvious cycling problem, it has been chosen to solve it iteratively: all feed
assay are iteratively updated, blending the proper product and tail, then using
the updated feed assay, the new product and tail assay are recomputed. This
process it repeated until the change in the different assays is smaller than the
set precision (1e-8 by default).

Other hypothesis will be explored in the future, such as maintaining the ideal
stage of the cascade through a tuning of the cuts values $\theta_{i}$ of each
stage of the cascade, or maintaining $\alpha\beta = const$ as described in
\cite{walker2017}.

Note that as a consequence of our design method, the cascade product and tail
assay will not necessary match the targeted values, and usually slightly over
enrich and over strip the product and the tail.

\section{The experiment}

As explain previously, the goal of this work is to assess the rate of the HEU
production using enrichment cascade designed within the JCPOA agreement
constrains. For this work two different cases will be investigated and compare
to the reference case.
i
\subsection{the studied cases}
\subsubsection{Reference Case}
The reference case corresponds to a cascade design include all the 5060
centrifuges available within JCPOA targeting an enriched product at $90\%$ of U-235,
stripping the tail product up to 0.28 $\%$ from a feed of natural uranium. 
The design cascade in this case, includes 4 stripping stages, and 38 enriching
stages. The Feed/Product/Tail (F/P/T) assay are respectively
0.0071/0.903/0.0028.

\subsubsection{Case 1}
The case 1 is design to allow configure 30 cascades in the scenario (limit of
the JCPOA agreement), all design the same way. The design properties are:\\
- less than 169 centrifuges per cascade,\\
- F/P/T assays: 0.0071/0.035/0.003.\\
The corresponding design is:\\
- 167 centrifuges,\\
- F/P/T assays: 0.0071/0.0412842/0.00290548.\\

\subsubsection{Case 2}
The case 2 is design is also limited to 30 cascades in the scenario (limit of
the JCPOA agreement), but this time each level of cascade are designed to get
feed with the previous level product and to have 4 stripping stages and 10
enriching stages. The configuration of the different level of cascade can be
found in table \ref{tab:cascadelvl}. The different cascades don't have the same
geometry: the number of centrifuges per stage depends on their own design and
varies slightly from a level to another.

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\toprule

Level   &           & Assay     &       & Machines  \\

\midrule
1       & 0.0071    & 0.0413    & 0.0029 & 167       \\
2       & 0.0413    & 0.2043    & 0.0173 & 169       \\
3       & 0.2043    & 0.5941    & 0.0971 & 168       \\
4       & 0.5941    & 0.8834    & 0.3915 & 168       \\
5       & 0.8834    & 0.9735    & 0.7746 & 169       \\

\end{table}


\subsection{the simulation}
The simulation is build to layer up the different cascade in order to produce
HEU. The different layers of cascade will be called levels in the following. The
first task has been to determine the number of level required to produce HEU.
The optimum number of cascade per level is determine (the same way) that the
centrifuges are distributed on the different cascade stages.
Once both the number of levels and the number of cascades per level is
determined, the simulation is ran.


\section{Results}

\subsection{Assays}
\subsubsection{Case 1}
As shows on Figure \ref{ }, without tails recycling, the number of cascade level
required to enrich the uranium up to $90\%$ are respectively 5 for the
first case considered. Recycling the tails, allow to reduce the number of
enrichment levels required to enrich natural uranium up to a high enrich level
to 3.

This bump in enrichment can easily be explained, as the cascade don't have the
same number of stages, there is less stripping enrichment work, than enriching
work. That is to say that even work in an ideal case (where the stripping work of a
stage is the exact inverse of the enrich work), with an cascade with less
stripping stage than enriching stage will produce tail with a higher enrichment
than the feed of the previous level of

Excessive sectioning in a three-page document is discouraged, but here are more
subsections to demonstrate compliance with the ANS formatting guidelines.

\subsubsection{Third-level Heading}
This subsubsection shows compliance with the ANS-specified standard. This level
